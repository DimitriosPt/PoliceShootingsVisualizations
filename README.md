# Zoomable Sunburst

This is a Javascript visualization of Zoomable Sunburst using d3.js .

# How to use it?

## Note
These visualizations work only on http or https requests. Opening the html file in a browser throws an error. So we need to setup a local host server on the computer. Follow the below command to setup a server and see the visualization:

#### Python 2
If you have Python installed...

Change directory into the folder where your file some.html or file(s) exist using the command cd /path/to/your/folder

Start up a Python web server using the command python -m SimpleHTTPServer

This will start a web server that hosts your entire directory listing, which will be made accessible through the following URL: http://localhost:8000

You can use a custom port  python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000 giving you link: http://localhost:9000
This approach is built in to any Python installation.
